# Overview

## Questions addressed

Voice and facial recognition technologies are extremely revolutionary in today’s world. From your google home mini to transcriptions voice recognition software is expanding. Facial recognition is also growing at a fast rate, with phone unlocks and criminal tracking. Both of these technologies had struggled in the past, with biases. For voice recognition, this is accents and gender. Facial recognition is with gender and different racial groups. We wanted to explore the biases in modern and current recognition algorithms provided by big tech companies. These algorithms are industry standards and are used by big tech and tech companies that require recognition.

## Form of our project

In our project, we wanted to explore different statistics and examine the progress made in both visual and audio recognition technology. A website is the option we chose, since it gives us access to the APIs and flexibility to interact with a blog and creatively build our own interactive portion that uses these recognition APIs for demo. In addition, there are fun features to try out on our website related to the topic of recognition.

## Results of our findings

In voice recognition, Google and other big tech companies lack behind a little in accuracy, especially with people that have accents that are not supported. Currently, there is a limited number of English types that are supported and the correct one must be selected manually for maximum speech-to-text accuracy.

In facial recognition, we found that Google’s Cloud Vision API for identifying emotions in faces was fairly accurate at detecting emotions such as joy, anger, sorrow, and surprise. Although the disparity in accuracy wasn’t extremely significant among different genders and ethnic groups, we did notice that the confidence levels for various emotions were not as consistent for portraits of darker-skinned women.
