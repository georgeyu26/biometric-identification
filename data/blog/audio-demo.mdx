# Voice API findings and testing results

Our group took the liberty to test two very popular and growing speech-to-text algorithms.

We tried both the WhisperAPI by OpenAI, and also Google Cloud's popular solution to the problem

WhisperAPI could be called in one simple HTTP POST request and can tanscribe that audio very easily with the use of
an API key. I was able to run the API on the file URL, and the API would download and transcribe the file without problem.
The response includes the text, but also timings of when each word is transcribed.

```bash
curl --request POST \
--url 'https://transcribe.whisperapi.com' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
-F "file=@YOUR_FILE_PATH" \
-F "url=YOUR_URL" \
-F "diarization=false" \
-F "numSpeakers=2" \
-F "fileType=YOUR_FILE_TYPE" \
-F "language=en" \
-F "task=transcribe"
```

GCP on the other hand is more complex to setup, you must have an account with free-tier and payment methods setup beforehand for
it to function. They provide 60 minutes of free tier, and paid after that. Google trades simplicity for better language support and customizability.
There are dialects of English selected, but for our example we will use Canadian.

The process of getting the text in GCP is also more difficult, the results are posted in JSON format, but they are not grouped together.

# Tests

## Test Format

The tests we will run are limited in scope, since we do not have too much datasets to work with.
In the case of limited data sets, we handpicked a couple of interesting people with different accents from the traditional American or English accents
and tried to gauge the accuracy of these services.

## Jamaican/Carribean man speaking english

We will provide the transcriptions of each service in markdown blocks.

Here is the original audio:

Clare: What was your first impression of Sheffield when you came here?

Joseph: Well it was funny, because when I look around and see the houses, everything was in one.
Back home in Jamaica each individual have their own home and spaces; you have your own land; we didn't have a great big houses.
People have the, were of, of the precession that we were living in trees and all sort of thing than house, like some time they're portray that on t, on the radio and on television.
But there ain't anything like that.
We all have our own home; nice little home and we have great deal of land.
Your next neighbour might be so many metres away from you and things weren't single file.
When I arrive in England and when I look and see the houses I thought they were factories, because everything all together.
Then after a few days you get to understand that that's not so.
These were houses and then you realise how a detach house is, semi-detach and then you just automatic, automatically got into the swing and accept what you've seen here.
But for me I was comfortable as I says and, uhm, in couple of days I foun, I got my own, I got a job and that makes things easy.
And then I work on that job for a few months and then I s, went to, we start recruiting, because my relative, they were involve in this Community Association business and they were in the process of, uhm, finding homes for people that just arriving, new arrival in this country and, uh, helping them settle down and finding jobs.
So I got in the midst of that.
So with me having, getting that bit of knowledge, things comes easy to me and when Sheffield Transport start to recruit people for conducting on trams I went down and took an interview and I start working as a conductor.
I was one of the first black person to, uhm, start it on the Sheffield Tramway and from that they took the trams off and I became a tr, bus, uh, bus conductor for couple of weeks.
And then I was a driver and I've done that for thirty-five-and-a-half years.

What was your first impression of Jeff Yule when you came here? It was funny because when I look around and see the houses everything was in one.
Back home in Jamaica, each individual of their own home and spaces, your own land.
We didn't have a great big houses.
People of the precession that we were living in trees and also out of the dugouts.
But sometimes they're portrayed at an unbeirutable television.
But we are in anything like that.
We are our own home, nicely close and we have a great deal of land.
Your next neighbor might be so many meters away from you.
And things were in single five.
When they arrived in England and when I look and see the houses, I thought they were factories because everything is all together.
Then after a few days you get to understand that that's not so.
These were houses and then you realize that the detachment was a semi detachment.
And then you just automatically go into this thing and accept what you've seen here.
But for me I was comfortable as I said and in a couple of days I got a job and that makes things easy.
And then I worked on that job for a few months and then we start recruiting because my relatives were involved in this community association business and they were in the process of finding homes for people that just arrived in your rival in this country and helping them settle down and find jobs.
So I got into the midst of that.
With me having getting that bit of knowledge, things comes easy to me and when she'll transport starter recruits, people for conducting and trams, I went down and took an interview and I started working as a conductor.
I was one of the first black person to start it in the Sheffield Tramway and from that the trams off and I became a bus conductor for a couple of weeks and then a bus driver and I don't know what 35 and a half years.

but it was funny cuz when I look around and see the hours is everything was in one back home in Jamaica
each individual have their own home and spaces you have your own life we didn't have a great big houses people of the procession that we were living in threes and a sort of things that sometime they're pretty tree.

## Findings from Jamaican Voice Sample

Just from a simple glance, OpenAI's WhisperAPI does a lot better than Google's solution.
It is able to distinguish quite easily, even through an accent the words that are being conveyed.

Google on the otherhand, hand more random words or 'misheard words' that were registered in the transcription.
This can be caused by Google's large selection of different languages, but not having a language similar to the Jamaican accent.
It seems that Google's service might be more fine tuned by a per-language basis rather than OpenAI, being able to handle all cases.

```
I have always had a strong feeling to rebel. Even as a child, the more I was suppressed,
the more I resisted. In a conservative society, it was not easy for me or anyone around
me. I had a burning fire inside me. How can my country have such a richness of people
and culture and yet so much darkness? I decided to show this richness by telling the
stories of the communities that did not fit in the single narrative of my country. A
narrative that dictates how we have to think and how we have to live. A narrative that
nurtures fundamentalism and makes people radical and unaccepting. I am from Pakistan and
I make films. One by one, the heroes of my films became devices of hope for their
communities. Their diverse communities accepted me, let me in and let me tell their
stories to the world. One of these stories is about K2. K2 is the second highest and
most dangerous mountain in the world. While I was filming the hardships of the climbers
at K2, I noticed the hardships of the porters. They trace the routes of the deadly
mountains and carry the luggage of climbers on their back. While foreign climbers are
appreciated for their summits, these porters are deprived of any recognition. There I
met Hassan Sadpara, one of the high-altitude porter and climber. He's the first ever
Pakistani who scaled six 8,000-meter peaks, including Mount Everest, the highest peak in
the world. Through his story, the world first time found out about these struggles and
resistance of porters in Pakistan. Like mountaineers, the folk musicians of Pakistan are
also victims of social disregard. Faqeer Zulfiqar is the only musician in Pakistan who
plays boreendo, a 5,000-year-old clay musical instrument. In my eyes, he is an
inspiration, a hero, keeping our rich traditions alive. While we were filming our
documentary about dying folk musical instruments, some people near his village tried to
stop us. They could not tolerate something as forbidden as music being filmed. Imagine
an artist who depends on music for their survival. They have to go through the pain of
being called names and declared unfit for society. My third hero is my friend, Sarah
Gill. She made history by becoming Pakistan's first transgender doctor. Transgender
people are the most disrespected members of our community, discarded by everyone and
faced with so much discrimination, they are often left with two options for their
survival. Begging or prostitution. Sarah, however, made an exceptional achievement. But
breaking stereotypes was not easy for her. Her resilience is an inspiration. My films
carry the voice of these people far and wide. Our climber, Hassan Sadpara, was
recognized for his achievement. He was awarded a prize from Prime Minister of Pakistan
in 2015. Faqeer Zulfiqar got the Pride of Performance Award from the government in 2020.
The local government introduced music classes and scholarships for the folk and
classical musicians in Punjab Institute of Language, Art and Culture. Sarah became a
beacon of hope, a role model and voice of trans society in Pakistan. By telling these
untold stories, I hope to give a voice to the free thinkers of my country. For me, this
is an achievement and an act of defiance at the same time. Documentary is a space for
debate, a space for dialogue, a means to challenge the darkness of this society. And
there is so much darkness around us. Our internal fire and spark is the only way to
eradicate it. And that is my power to continue.

### Original Transcript

```
Waddling along the parched Australian earth, this female platypus is searching for fresh
water. Over the past year, a severe drought turned rivers and streams to mere trickles.
She barely survived and was unable to reproduce. Could the next year bring a change in
luck? 00:30 It's autumn and fat raindrops finally come spilling from the sky. Within
days, the platypus finds a river and begins to hunt. Her webbed feet propel her along
and her waterproof coat traps heat close to her body. Underwater, she senses her
surroundings with her duck-like bill, which is fitted with about 40,000
electroreceptors. This allows her to detect the minuscule electrical signals coming from
a glass shrimp’s nerves and muscles. She makes it a quick meal. And once she clambers
back on land to construct a burrow, she waddles in a lizard-like posture, her limbs
moving horizontally to her spine. 01:14 The platypus has many quirks. As a monotreme,
she's part of the most ancient lineage of mammals alive today. Consequently, she has a
curious mix of mammalian, avian, and reptilian features, which is reflected in her
genome. For instance, mammals usually have one pair of chromosomes that determine sex.
But the platypus has five, which more closely resemble a bird’s. Let's hope she gets to
put them to use. 01:45 She regains her strength and, as winter turns to spring, it’s
time to mate. However, she can’t raise her young here. The surrounding land has begun to
be deforested, causing the riverbank to erode. Instead, she journeys upstream and
settles in a clear, deep pool sheltered by a river red gum tree. Suddenly, a rustle
flushes birds from the undergrowth and a fox appears. These predators have threatened
platypuses ever since they were introduced to Australia by white settlers in 1855. The
fox doesn’t see her this time, but the platypus will need to stay alert. 02:27 Two males
also occupy this area and, soon enough, they begin competing for her affections. Each
has spurs on its hind legs containing a potent snake-like venom. One male fights the
other off and courts the female over several weeks, swimming alongside her, and
occasionally biting her tail. Eventually, she reciprocates, and they swim around in
circles before doing the deed. The male platypus has a penis with eccentric features
like two heads and spines that aid and fertilization. 03:02 Over the following week, the
female constructs an extensive burrow furnished with a cozy nest. She plugs up the
tunnels leading in, making them appear as dead ends to potential predators. Then, much
like a reptile or bird, she lays eggs from her cloaca, a single opening that's used for
both reproduction and excretion. She incubates her eggs, and as the river red gum tree
blooms, her offspring hatch. 03:33 Like other mammals, she feeds them milk. But unlike
other mammals, she has no nipples. Instead, her milk oozes from mammary glands onto her
belly, where her babies slurp it up. This pooled milk invites bacteria, but the platypus
also produces potent antibacterial proteins, ensuring her newborns are safe. 03:57 She
continues nursing them for four months— hunting, evading the fox, and repairing her
burrow all the while. By the time her young are ready to make their debut, the summer is
waning. One evening, after the female platypus returns from hunting, she finds that one
nestling has already struck off on its own. A few days later, the other also leaves the
borough. Soon, her young are living completely independently. And eventually they’ll
leave this part of the river to make homes of their own.
