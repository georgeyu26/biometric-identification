# Introduction

Voice recognition algorithms have been around for a long time. They are features often found in smartphones and smart home devices. Transcribing audio to text is something that is done by many different services such as youtube.

Voice recognition systems are systems that help recognize and translate spoken language into text. Over the past few years, voice recognition and natural language processing systems have progressed an incredible amount. For many people, voice recognition systems have become prominent in their lives through software such as digital assistants like Siri and Alexa, and Google Assistant. Furthermore, other speech-to-text programs for various different languages have also become extremely powerful, some being able to type 160 words per minute with a 99% accuracy rate, likely more accurate than a human! Anecdotally, even things like closed captions have improved significantly over the past few years. This comes along with the increased availability of big data that has been being gathered and consumed by big tech companies.

Nowadays, software to transcribe text is easily available to everyone. Software such as Google Cloud Speech-to-text is low price and is well documented. At this point, anyone can do voice recognition! In addition, Google Cloud also has sentiment analysis APIs that can help users measure the sentiment of the text provided.

While voice recognition currently has a lot of uses, the use cases are continuing to expand. Digital assistants and other software in our phones and computers are improving at rapid speeds, and are even continue to expand into things such as cars and watches. Other use cases include customer support becoming able to answer questions thoroughly at a faster pace, and medical transcription software to capture patient diagnosis notes. Overall, the voice recognition market is predicted to reach USD \$27 billion in 2026, which in comparison to the USD \$10.7 billion in 2020. It is clear that the voice recognition market is growing fast.

It will be important to ensure that alongside speech recognition’s capabilities growth, the use cases that it grows into are responsible and operate without bias. Currently, studies have shown that speech recognition is less accurate when dealing with female voices. Furthermore, even the best voice recognition algorithms are still struggling with recognizing the accents of people from different regions in the world. As an example, the Algorithmic Justice League’s Voice Erasure project found that that speech recognition systems from Apple, Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft collectively achieve word error rates of 35% for African American voices versus 19% for white voices. In general, “on average, all five programs from leading technology companies like Apple and Microsoft showed significant race disparities; they were twice as likely to incorrectly transcribe audio from Black speakers as opposed to white speakers.” In its current state, users of voice recognition software have to adjust themselves to the algorithms biases, rather than the other way around. This can be problematic, and hopefully in the near future, these algorithms will improve even more as more data becomes available for these algorithms.

# Voice API findings and testing results

Our group took the liberty to test two very popular and growing speech-to-text algorithms.

We tried both the WhisperAPI by OpenAI, and also Google Cloud's popular solution to the problem

WhisperAPI could be called in one simple HTTP POST request and can tanscribe that audio very easily with the use of
an API key. I was able to run the API on the file URL, and the API would download and transcribe the file without problem.
The response includes the text, but also timings of when each word is transcribed.

```bash
curl --request POST \
--url 'https://transcribe.whisperapi.com' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
-F "file=@YOUR_FILE_PATH" \
-F "url=YOUR_URL" \
-F "diarization=false" \
-F "numSpeakers=2" \
-F "fileType=YOUR_FILE_TYPE" \
-F "language=en" \
-F "task=transcribe"
```

GCP on the other hand is more complex to setup, you must have an account with free-tier and payment methods setup beforehand for
it to function. They provide 60 minutes of free tier, and paid after that. Google trades simplicity for better language support and customizability.
There are dialects of English selected, but for our example we will use Canadian.

The process of getting the text in GCP is also more difficult, the results are posted in JSON format, but they are not grouped together.

# Tests

## Test Format

The tests we will run are limited in scope, since we do not have too much datasets to work with.
In the case of limited data sets, we handpicked a couple of interesting people with different accents from the traditional American or English accents
and tried to gauge the accuracy of these services.

## Jamaican/Carribean man speaking english

We will provide the transcriptions of each service in markdown blocks.

What was your first impression of Sheffield when you came here?

Well it was funny, because when I look around and see the houses, everything was in one.
Back home in Jamaica each individual have their own home and spaces; you have your own land; we didn't have a great big houses.
People have the, were of, of the precession that we were living in trees and all sort of thing than house, like some time they're portray that on t, on the radio and on television.
But there ain't anything like that.
We all have our own home; nice little home and we have great deal of land.
Your next neighbour might be so many metres away from you and things weren't single file.
When I arrive in England and when I look and see the houses I thought they were factories, because everything all together.
Then after a few days you get to understand that that's not so.
These were houses and then you realise how a detach house is, semi-detach and then you just automatic, automatically got into the swing and accept what you've seen here.
But for me I was comfortable as I says and, uhm, in couple of days I foun, I got my own, I got a job and that makes things easy.
And then I work on that job for a few months and then I s, went to, we start recruiting, because my relative, they were involve in this Community Association business and they were in the process of, uhm, finding homes for people that just arriving, new arrival in this country and, uh, helping them settle down and finding jobs.
So I got in the midst of that.
So with me having, getting that bit of knowledge, things comes easy to me and when Sheffield Transport start to recruit people for conducting on trams I went down and took an interview and I start working as a conductor.
I was one of the first black person to, uhm, start it on the Sheffield Tramway and from that they took the trams off and I became a tr, bus, uh, bus conductor for couple of weeks.
And then I was a driver and I've done that for thirty-five-and-a-half years.

What was your first impression of Jeff Yule when you came here? It was funny because when
I look around and see the houses everything was in one. Back home in Jamaica, each
individual of their own home and spaces, your own land. We didn't have a great big houses.
People of the precession that we were living in trees and also out of the dugouts. But
sometimes they're portrayed at an unbeirutable television. But we are in anything like
that. We are our own home, nicely close and we have a great deal of land. Your next
neighbor might be so many meters away from you. And things were in single five. When they
arrived in England and when I look and see the houses, I thought they were factories
because everything is all together. Then after a few days you get to understand that
that's not so. These were houses and then you realize that the detachment was a semi
detachment. And then you just automatically go into this thing and accept what you've seen
here. But for me I was comfortable as I said and in a couple of days I got a job and that
makes things easy. And then I worked on that job for a few months and then we start
recruiting because my relatives were involved in this community association business and
they were in the process of finding homes for people that just arrived in your rival in
this country and helping them settle down and find jobs. So I got into the midst of that.
With me having getting that bit of knowledge, things comes easy to me and when she'll
transport starter recruits, people for conducting and trams, I went down and took an
interview and I started working as a conductor. I was one of the first black person to
start it in the Sheffield Tramway and from that the trams off and I became a bus conductor
for a couple of weeks and then a bus driver and I don't know what 35 and a half years.

what was your first impression of Jack you when you came here but it was funny cuz when I
look around and see the hours is everything was in one back home in Jamaica each
individual have their own home and spaces you have your own life we didn't have a great
big houses people of the procession that we were living in threes and a sort of things
that sometime they're pretty tree. Turn on the radio and television nice little amount we
have great deal of land your next neighbour might be so many metres away from you and
things one single fact when I arrive in England when I look on CV hours is I thought they
were factors because everything all together then after a few days you get to understand
that that's not so these why I was his and then you realize or detach hose is attached and
then you just automatically automatically got into this week and accept what you see in me
I thought I'd like me oh I got a job and that makes things easy and then I work on that
job for a few months and then I went to we start recruiting Because my relative they were
involved in this Community Association business and they were in the process of finding a
home for people that just arrived in your arrival in this country and helping them settle
down and finding jobs so I got him the mist of that so wake me up in getting that bit of
knowledge things comes easy to me and when Sheffield transport start to recruit people for
conducting and Rams I went down at 2 p.m. interview and I thought working as a conductor I
was one of the first black person to start it and a chef in Tramway and from that they
took the trams up and I became a bus but conduct of a couple of weeks and then a bus
driver and I'm done at 4:35 and a half years

## Findings from Jamaican Voice Sample

Just from a simple glance, OpenAI's WhisperAPI does a lot better than Google's solution.
It is able to distinguish quite easily, even through an accent the words that are being conveyed.
In our example WhisperAPI was at 83% text similarity to the original transcript.
Google cloud's accuracy was lower at 80%.

Google on the otherhand, hand more random words or 'misheard words' that were registered in the transcription.
This can be caused by Google's large selection of different languages, but not having a language similar to the Jamaican accent.
It seems that Google's service might be more fine tuned by a per-language basis rather than OpenAI, being able to handle all cases.

I have always had a strong feeling to rebel. Even as a child, the more I was suppressed,
the more I resisted. In a conservative society, it was not easy for me or anyone around
me. I had a burning fire inside me. How can my country have such a richness of people
and culture and yet so much darkness? I decided to show this richness by telling the
stories of the communities that did not fit in the single narrative of my country. A
narrative that dictates how we have to think and how we have to live. A narrative that
nurtures fundamentalism and makes people radical and unaccepting. I am from Pakistan and
I make films. One by one, the heroes of my films became devices of hope for their
communities. Their diverse communities accepted me, let me in and let me tell their
stories to the world. One of these stories is about K2. K2 is the second highest and
most dangerous mountain in the world. While I was filming the hardships of the climbers
at K2, I noticed the hardships of the porters. They trace the routes of the deadly
mountains and carry the luggage of climbers on their back. While foreign climbers are
appreciated for their summits, these porters are deprived of any recognition. There I
met Hassan Sadpara, one of the high-altitude porter and climber. He's the first ever
Pakistani who scaled six 8,000-meter peaks, including Mount Everest, the highest peak in
the world. Through his story, the world first time found out about these struggles and
resistance of porters in Pakistan. Like mountaineers, the folk musicians of Pakistan are
also victims of social disregard. Faqeer Zulfiqar is the only musician in Pakistan who
plays boreendo, a 5,000-year-old clay musical instrument. In my eyes, he is an
inspiration, a hero, keeping our rich traditions alive. While we were filming our
documentary about dying folk musical instruments, some people near his village tried to
stop us. They could not tolerate something as forbidden as music being filmed. Imagine
an artist who depends on music for their survival. They have to go through the pain of
being called names and declared unfit for society. My third hero is my friend, Sarah
Gill. She made history by becoming Pakistan's first transgender doctor. Transgender
people are the most disrespected members of our community, discarded by everyone and
faced with so much discrimination, they are often left with two options for their
survival. Begging or prostitution. Sarah, however, made an exceptional achievement. But
breaking stereotypes was not easy for her. Her resilience is an inspiration. My films
carry the voice of these people far and wide. Our climber, Hassan Sadpara, was
recognized for his achievement. He was awarded a prize from Prime Minister of Pakistan
in 2015. Faqeer Zulfiqar got the Pride of Performance Award from the government in 2020.
The local government introduced music classes and scholarships for the folk and
classical musicians in Punjab Institute of Language, Art and Culture. Sarah became a
beacon of hope, a role model and voice of trans society in Pakistan. By telling these
untold stories, I hope to give a voice to the free thinkers of my country. For me, this
is an achievement and an act of defiance at the same time. Documentary is a space for
debate, a space for dialogue, a means to challenge the darkness of this society. And
there is so much darkness around us. Our internal fire and spark is the only way to
eradicate it. And that is my power to continue.

Waddling along the parched Australian earth, this female platypus is searching for fresh
water. Over the past year, a severe drought turned rivers and streams to mere trickles.
She barely survived and was unable to reproduce. Could the next year bring a change in
luck? 00:30 It's autumn and fat raindrops finally come spilling from the sky. Within
days, the platypus finds a river and begins to hunt. Her webbed feet propel her along
and her waterproof coat traps heat close to her body. Underwater, she senses her
surroundings with her duck-like bill, which is fitted with about 40,000
electroreceptors. This allows her to detect the minuscule electrical signals coming from
a glass shrimp’s nerves and muscles. She makes it a quick meal. And once she clambers
back on land to construct a burrow, she waddles in a lizard-like posture, her limbs
moving horizontally to her spine. 01:14 The platypus has many quirks. As a monotreme,
she's part of the most ancient lineage of mammals alive today. Consequently, she has a
curious mix of mammalian, avian, and reptilian features, which is reflected in her
genome. For instance, mammals usually have one pair of chromosomes that determine sex.
But the platypus has five, which more closely resemble a bird’s. Let's hope she gets to
put them to use. 01:45 She regains her strength and, as winter turns to spring, it’s
time to mate. However, she can’t raise her young here. The surrounding land has begun to
be deforested, causing the riverbank to erode. Instead, she journeys upstream and
settles in a clear, deep pool sheltered by a river red gum tree. Suddenly, a rustle
flushes birds from the undergrowth and a fox appears. These predators have threatened
platypuses ever since they were introduced to Australia by white settlers in 1855. The
fox doesn’t see her this time, but the platypus will need to stay alert. 02:27 Two males
also occupy this area and, soon enough, they begin competing for her affections. Each
has spurs on its hind legs containing a potent snake-like venom. One male fights the
other off and courts the female over several weeks, swimming alongside her, and
occasionally biting her tail. Eventually, she reciprocates, and they swim around in
circles before doing the deed. The male platypus has a penis with eccentric features
like two heads and spines that aid and fertilization. 03:02 Over the following week, the
female constructs an extensive burrow furnished with a cozy nest. She plugs up the
tunnels leading in, making them appear as dead ends to potential predators. Then, much
like a reptile or bird, she lays eggs from her cloaca, a single opening that's used for
both reproduction and excretion. She incubates her eggs, and as the river red gum tree
blooms, her offspring hatch. 03:33 Like other mammals, she feeds them milk. But unlike
other mammals, she has no nipples. Instead, her milk oozes from mammary glands onto her
belly, where her babies slurp it up. This pooled milk invites bacteria, but the platypus
also produces potent antibacterial proteins, ensuring her newborns are safe. 03:57 She
continues nursing them for four months— hunting, evading the fox, and repairing her
burrow all the while. By the time her young are ready to make their debut, the summer is
waning. One evening, after the female platypus returns from hunting, she finds that one
nestling has already struck off on its own. A few days later, the other also leaves the
borough. Soon, her young are living completely independently. And eventually they’ll
leave this part of the river to make homes of their own.

Ted Audio Collective It's Ted Talks, Ailey. I'm your host, Elise Hugh. The unsung heroes
of congested urban areas are motorcycle cab drivers. And Lagos, they're the ones getting
millions to work and other places they need to go. But their vehicles are powered by
dirty, high polluting fuels. In his Ted 2022 talk, Otter Tio Bommi Duro shares his work
to take these vehicles electric and transform the lives and livelihoods of drivers along
the way. After the break. I join you from Lagos, Nigeria, one of the larger cities in
Africa. By 2050, Lagos will outgrow many of the larger cities in the world, including
New York and Mexico City. And will be home to over 32 million people. By that same date,
Nigeria will be home to more people than the United States. But there is a problem.
Lagos and other African-Megas cities suffer or are plagued by limited road
infrastructure, pollution, congestion and poor city conditions. This makes it very
difficult for people to get to work, especially in low-income communities, where poverty
infrastructure gaps are pervasive. Enter the African motorcycle taxi driver. Driving on
two and three wheels, they reach through the congested streets of Africa, getting people
and goods to where they need to be. Unfortunately, these drivers are excluded from the
formal economy. Unable to afford to buy clean, efficient vehicles, they are left to rent
old gas engines from exploitative loan sharks. Because of this tough situation that
these drivers endure, they are often left to friend for themselves. Part of what they
also endure and suffer is high costs of operations from these exploitative loan sharks.
And also, these drivers pollute the environment. If nothing is done, pollution from two
and three wheels vehicles in Africa will hit 1.7 gigatons of emissions every year
according to our estimates. This is equivalent to pollution from two million Boeing 737
airplanes every single year. I left my engineering job in 2013 to go to MIT where I met
my co-founder, Cheney Duazador, a fellow engineer with similar dreams. We bonded about
the realization that Africa was being left behind in the global transition to clean
mobility. Inspired by the work of other innovators around the world, we chose to embark
on a journey to create a three-part solution, which provides motorcycle taxi drivers in
Africa access to electric vehicles, battery swaps and maintenance, and also emergency
assistance. Here is how it works. Drivers sign up on the platform and instantly they get
access to an electric motorcycle and a full battery swap. So therefore, they are able to
save up and earn money to buy those vehicles. In addition, we also help lower their
risks by providing them access to emergency response, health insurance, and maintenance
plans. This represents an integrated approach to the design, manufacturing, financing,
and operations of an electric mobility platform, targeted at highly vulnerable,
informal, and on-banked people groups. The revenue from the drivers covers the cost of
the electric fleet and the batteries, while the cost of R&D and technology is covered by
our partners, including foundations, nonprofits, and investors. Meet Baba Gmeru, one of
our drivers. Before signing up on our platform, he was a small holder farmer earning $3
a day in the Bamboo Bamboo community in southwestern Nigeria. Try that this stroke when
Baba Gmeru lost his first son. Without help, he struggled to transport from produce, and
therefore could not make ends meet. After signing up on our platform, he immediately got
access to an electric motorcycle plus a fully charged battery on a daily basis. This
enabled him to be able to transport people in his community, make a little bit more
money, and also meet his obligations, including sending his younger son to school. Our
platform enabled him to increase his net income on a daily basis from $3 to $6. Today,
our platform has served a network of over 15,000 drivers, and our data shows that the
average driver has about 5 dependents, meaning that our work has likely impacted over
75,000 livelihoods. By 2025, our goal is to provide electric mobility solutions to over
150,000 drivers. And if this idea really takes off, electric mobility innovators and
climate entrepreneurs in Africa could jointly impact over 10 million motorcycle taxi
drivers. By doing this, we will be helping to move the world's youngest and fastest
growing continent towards a more sustainable and a prosperous future, and we will be
creating jobs and reducing emissions. Thank you very much. For millennia, we have
debated the link between our mental, physical, and spiritual health. So where are we
now? We're going to have major breakthroughs in the ability to integrate the whole mind.
What does consenting look feel and sound like for me, and how do I recognize that in
other people? I think of it as energy. Are we amplifying our energy? Are we diminishing
our energy? Mind body spirit, a three-part series on the Ted Radio Hour from NPR. Listen
wherever you get your podcasts. Ted Talks daily is hosted by me, Elise Hugh, and
produced by Ted. The music is from Alison Layton Brown, and our mixer is Christopher
Faisy-Bogan. We record the talks at Ted Events We Host, or from Ted X Events, which are
organized independently by volunteers all over the world. And we'd love to hear from
you. Leave us a review on Apple podcasts or email us at podcasts at Ted.com. PRX.

hole the father earning $3 a day in the bama bama community in southwestern Nigeria had a
stroke when Robert Barrow lost his first son without help he struggled to transport Farm
produce and therefore could not make ends meet after sign up on a platform humidity got
access to a little motorcycle blast a fully charged battery on a daily basis this enabled
him to be able to transport people in his community make a little bit more money and also
meet its obligations including sending his younger son to school apart from enable them to
increase in net income on a daily basis from $3 to $6 to date a pastor must have the
network of over 15,000 drivers and Our Data shows that the average driver has about five
dependents meaning that our work has likely impacted over 75,000 livelihoods by 2025 our
goal is to provide electric mobility solutions to over 150,000 drivers and if this idea
really take the electric mobility innovative and climate entrepreneurs in Africa called

move the world's youngest and fastest-growing continent towards a more sustainable and a
prosperous future and we will be creating jobs and reducing emissions thank you very much

### Results of Nigerian Voice

In this benchmark, for Google Cloud's Service we chose the Nigerian English, this means that the
transcription test should be fair against OpenAI's whisperAPI.
After text similarity check the results are:
98% similar for Whisper and 96% for Google. This makes both options extremely accurate for their use cases
and a good job done for both companies.

## Overall findings from our investigation

We found through investigations that there is still a lot of work to do in big tech on improving voice recognition
to a better level. In comparison, the Open Source side of OpenAI has done an incredible job with English and understanding all types
of accents without manually telling the program what it is. The accuracy figures of the WhisperAPI was consistently greater than Google's in terms of
accuracy. Currently there is also the parallel of ChatGPT being a better AI Chatbot experience than Bard, meaning that big tech such as Google may not
be the front runners of AI and ML algorithms currently.

Accuracy graph of various English accents

## Ethical conclusions

In conclusion, there is a lot of progress in voice detection in OpenAI. Voice recognition from Google is currently lacking behind, but provides
a decent experience. Some problems that can be found from the lack of accuracy is bad transcriptions in services such as Youtube videos, educational videos
where instructors may have a vastly different accent. This can lead to a hard time for students to understand their english, or could offend the instructors
for not being able to pick up on their English accent. On the bright side, the algorithms from OpenAI provide a great alternative to other companies
being quite accurate in a diverse audio set.
