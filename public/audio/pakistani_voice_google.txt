I have always had a strong feeling 2331 as a child the more I was suppressed the more I registered
 in a conservative society it was not easy for me or anyone around me
 I had a burning fire inside me how can my country have situation as of people and culture and yet so much darkness I decided to show this business by telling the stories of the communities that did not fit in the single narrative of my country
 a narrative that dictates how we have to think and how we have to live
 a narrative that nurtures fundamentalism and makes people tentacle and and accepting
 I am from pakistan and I make friends
 one by one the heroes of my films became the voices of hope for their communities their diverse communities accepted me let me in and let me tell their stories to the world one of these stories about K2 K2 is the second highest and most dangerous mountain in the world while I was filming the hardships of the climate setstate to I noticed the hardships of the Potter's that raise the roots at the Deadly mountains and carry the language of climbers on their back while foreign clients are appreciated for their Summit these ports are deprived of any recognition
 there I met her Sansad Dhara one of the high altitude Potter and calendar he is the first ever Pakistani who scaled 68 thousand peaks including Mount Everest is the highest peak in the world through his story the world first time found out about the struggles and resistance of voters in Pakistan like mountaineers the folk Musicians of Pakistan and also victim of social different guard Fakir Zulfikar is the only musician in Pakistan who plays out into a 5000 year old clay musical instrument
 in my eyes he is an inspiration Hero keeping a rich tradition se life
 while we were filming a documentary about dying folk musical instrument some people near his village try to stop us
 the could not tolerate something as forbidden as music being film
 imagine an artist who depends on music for their survival
 they have to go through the pain of being called names and declared unfit for the society
 my third hero is my friend Sara Gil she made history by becoming Pakistan's first transgender doctor class tender people are most respected members of our community discarded by everyone and faced with so much discrimination they are often left with two options for their survival
 dagang aur prostitution
 Sahara however made an exceptional achievement but breaking stereotypes was not easy for her
 odysseus is an inspiration
 my feelings carry the voice of these people far and wide our climate Hasan satpara was recognised for his achievement he was awarded a prize from Prime Minister of Pakistan in 2015
 Fakir julfikar got the pride of performance award from the government in 2020
 the local government introduced in music classes and scholarships for the folk and classical musicians in Punjab Institute of language art and culture Sarah became Beacon of hope a role model and voice of Trans society in Pakistan
 by telling this untold stories I hope to give a voice to the freethinkers of my country for me this is an achievement and an act of defiance at the same time
 documentary is the space for debate A space for dialogue a means to change the darkness of the society and there is so much darkness around as an internal fire and Spark is the only way to replicated and that is my power to continue thank you
