head REO collective it's a dark daily elite you the other time he rolls of a congested urban areas are motorcycle cab driver in Lagos they're the ones getting millions to work and other places they need to go but their vehicles are powered by dirty highfalutin fuel in his pad 2022 top auto tire Bobby Darrell shares his work to take these vehicles electric and transform the lives and livelihoods of drivers along the way up to the break journey from Lagos Nigeria
 what are the largest cities in in Africa
 by 2050 Lagos will outgrown men are the largest cities in the world including New York and Mexico City and will be home to over 32 million people by that same date Nigeria will be home tomorrow people the United States but there is a problem Lagos and other African megacities so far away plagued by limited rodeffer structure pollution congestion and possible conditions this makes it very difficult for people to get work especially in low-income communities where poverty infrastructure gaps are are pervasive enter the African motorcycle taxi driver driving on two and three wheels they reached through the congested streets of Africa getting people and goods to where they need to be
 unfortunately these drivers are excluded from the formal economy on able to afford to buy clean efficient vehicles they are left to rent old gas engines from exploitative loan sharks because of this tough situation that is drivers and be or they are often left to fend for themselves part of what they also and beyond so far is High costs of operations from the sex positive loan sharks and also these drivers pollute the environment if nothing is done pollution from two and three wheeled vehicles in Africa will hit 1.7 gigatonnes of emissions every year according to wire estimates this is equivalent to pollution from 2 million Boeing 737 airplanes every single year
 I left my engineering job in 2013 to go to MIT where I met my co-founder schedules order a fellow engineer with similar dreams we bonded over the realisation that Africa was been left behind in the Global transition to clean mobility inspired by the work of other innovators around the world who chose to embark on a journey to quit a three-part solution which provides motorcycle taxi drivers in Africa access to electric vehicles
 battery swaps and maintenance and also emergency assistance
 here's how it works driver sign up on the platform and he starts with the Galaxy S2 electric motorcycle and a full battery swap so therefore the able to save up and earn money to buy those vehicles in addition we also help lower there are risks by providing them access to emergency response health insurance and maintenance plan
 this represents an integrated approach to the design manufacturing financing and operations of electric mobility platform targeted at highly vulnerable informal and unbanked people groups the revenue from the drivers cover the cost of the electric field and the batteries were the cost of around their technology is covered by our partners including foundations nonprofit and investors
 mizpah barbero what about drivers before signing up on a platform it was a small hole the father earning $3 a day in the bama bama community in southwestern Nigeria had a stroke when Robert Barrow lost his first son without help he struggled to transport Farm produce and therefore could not make ends meet after sign up on a platform humidity got access to a little motorcycle blast a fully charged battery on a daily basis this enabled him to be able to transport people in his community
 make a little bit more money and also meet its obligations including sending his younger son to school apart from enable them to increase in net income on a daily basis from $3 to $6 to date a pastor must have the network of over 15,000 drivers and Our Data shows that the average driver has about five dependents meaning that our work has likely impacted over 75,000 livelihoods by 2025 our goal is to provide electric mobility solutions to over 150,000 drivers and if this idea really take the electric mobility innovative and climate entrepreneurs in Africa called jointly impact over 10 million motorcycle taxi drivers
 by doing this we will be helping to move the world's youngest and fastest-growing continent towards a more sustainable and a prosperous future and we will be creating jobs and reducing emissions thank you very much for your help so where are we now we don't have major breakthroughs in the ability to integrate the whole mind what is contending that feel and sound like for me and how do I recognise that in other people I think of it as energy are we amplifier energy are we diminishing our energy mind-body-spirit a three-part series on the Ted Radio Hour from NPR listen whenever you get your podcast TED talks daily is hosted by me early if you and produced by Ted the music is from Allison Layton brown and our mixer is Christopher baby bogan we record the talks
 caravans we host or from tedx events were organised independently by volunteers all over the world and we love to hear from you leave us a review on Apple podcasts or email at a podcast at telkom
