 but it was funny cuz when I look around and see the hours is everything was in one back home in Jamaica
 each individual have their own home and spaces you have your own life we didn't have a great big houses people of the procession that we were living in threes and a sort of things that sometime they're pretty tree. Turn on the radio and television nice little amount we have great deal of land your next neighbour might be so many metres away from you and things one single fact when I arrive in England when I look on CV hours is I thought they were factors because everything all together
 then after a few days you get to understand that that's not so these why I was his and then you realize or detach hose is attached and then you just automatically automatically got into this week and accept what you see in me I thought I'd like me oh I got a job and that makes things easy and then I work on that job for a few months and then I went to we start recruiting Because my relative they were involved in this Community Association business and they were in the process of finding a home for people that just arrived in your arrival in this country and helping them settle down and finding jobs
 so I got him the mist of that so wake me up in getting that bit of knowledge things comes easy to me and when Sheffield transport start to recruit people for conducting and Rams I went down at 2 p.m. interview and I thought working as a conductor I was one of the first black person to start it and a chef in Tramway and from that they took the trams up and I became a bus but conduct of a couple of weeks and then a bus driver and I'm done at 4:35 and a half years
